# dynamic-datasource-routing-examples

I have added three examples in this project where:

 *  The first example does not have thread bound access to a single datasource
 *  The second one is a bit more sophisticated example and i had learnt this later and have a thread bound access.
 *  The final one(third example) is the final product where I have used spring concepts using annotations to make a proper spring project that resolves the multi-tenant data architecture with Dynamic DataSource Routing using AbstractRoutingDataSource.
