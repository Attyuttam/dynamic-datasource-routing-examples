# dynamic-datasource-routing-examples

I have added two examples in this project where:
 ##1. The first example does not have thread bound access to a single datasource
 ##2. The second one is a bit more sophisticated example and i had learnt this later and have a thread bound access.

 I am still to work on the problems that arouse when we don't use the thread bound access.
